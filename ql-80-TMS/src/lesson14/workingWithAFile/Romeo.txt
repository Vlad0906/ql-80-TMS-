Here I found two of your servants and two of the Capulets in a fierce fight.
And I drew my sword to separate them; but then
the hot-tempered Tybalt appeared with his sword.
Challenging me, he stood over my head.
With his sword he cut the wind, and the wind,
unharmed, hissed at him. While the fight between us continued,
People began to come running from all sides,
And the fight erupted from all sides.
The Duke appeared, and the dispute was ended.
